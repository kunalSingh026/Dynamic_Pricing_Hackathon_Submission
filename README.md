## Overview

Urban parking is a growing challenge with congestion, limited space, and inefficient pricing. This project implements:

- Real-time **Dynamic Pricing Models** for parking lots
- Data-driven demand-based and competitive price adjustments
- Intelligent **Rerouting Suggestions** when lots are full or overpriced
- Real-time, interactive visualizations with **Bokeh**
- Compliant with strict technical constraints (Python, Pandas, Numpy, Pathway only)

```

**Workflow Summary:**

* Real-time parking data enters via a simulated stream
* Prices adjust based on demand, occupancy, and traffic
* Competitor pricing and proximity assessed with Numpy Haversine
* If lots are full or overpriced, rerouting suggestions provided
* Price trends visualized live using Bokeh

---

## Features

Three pricing models:

* Baseline Linear Pricing
* Demand-Based Dynamic Pricing
* Competitive Pricing with Rerouting

✅ Numpy-only distance calculations for strict compliance<br/>
✅ Smooth, bounded price variations (0.5x to 2x base price)<br/>
✅ Real-time interactive Bokeh visualizations<br/>
✅ Safe handling of unknown vehicle types and traffic conditions<br/>
✅ Fully aligned with Summer Analytics Capstone constraints

## 🖥️ Quick Start

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dynamic-parking-pricing-capstone.git
cd dynamic-parking-pricing-capstone
```

2. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Launch Notebook**

* Open `notebook.ipynb` in Jupyter or Colab
* Run all cells sequentially to view:
  ✅ Real-time price simulation
  ✅ Interactive visualizations
  ✅ Rerouting recommendations

## 📂 Dataset Details

`dataset.csv` contains simulated parking lot data with:

* Lot identifiers and GPS coordinates
* Capacity, occupancy, vehicle types
* Traffic conditions and timestamps

*For large datasets, a representative sample is provided for testing.*

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

* Manual Haversine implemented using `numpy` only (external packages avoided)
* Real-time behavior simulated with streaming logic and `time.sleep()`
* Fully tested, hackathon-compliant, and optimized for performance
